# Convolutional_Neural_Network
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project Overview:
Project Description:
This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch. It includes implementing various classes for different layers such as convolutional layers, max pooling layers, flatten layers, and activation functions. Additionally, it incorporates loss functions and optimizes the training of weights and biases using three different optimization techniques. The project also explores different methods for initializing weights.
